The Roadmap Builder is a visual tool where you define your tournament stages and connect them into a journey. Each stage can be Elimination or Round Robin, and different stages can use different formats.

## Stage Types

### Elimination

Teams play in groups, and the top performers advance to the next stage.

**How it works:**
- Teams are divided into groups (e.g., 4 groups of 12)
- Each group plays a set number of matches (up to 8)
- Points are calculated per match and accumulated
- Top teams from each group advance to the next stage (e.g., top 4 advance)

**Best for:** Early stages where you need to narrow down a large number of teams quickly.

**Example:** Open Qualifiers — 192 teams in 16 groups of 12. Each group plays 4 matches. Top 4 from each group advance to Semifinals.

### Round Robin

A cross-group format where groups play against each other. Points are calculated at multiple levels — per match, per pairing, per group, and per player.

**How it works:**
- Teams are split into groups
- Groups are paired against each other in cross-group matches
- Combined leaderboards across all pairings determine the final standings

**Best for:** Final stages where you want the fairest possible evaluation across all remaining teams.

**Example:** Grand Finals — 18 teams in 3 groups of 6. All 3 groups compete against each other across multiple matches. Combined leaderboard determines the champion.

## Mixing Formats

Different stages in the same tournament can use different formats. This is how major esports events like FFIC and FFWS operate.

**Example tournament:**
- **Stage 1: Open Qualifiers** — Elimination, 4 groups of 12 teams, top 4-5 advance
- **Stage 2: Grand Finals** — Round Robin, 3 groups of 6 teams, cross-group competition

Each stage is independent — set the format, matches per group, and advancement rules for each.

## Building Your Roadmap

1. **Add a stage** — give it a name (e.g., "Open Qualifiers", "Semifinals", "Grand Finals")
2. **Choose format** — Elimination or Round Robin
3. **Set group size** — how many teams per group (e.g., 12)
4. **Set matches per group** — up to 8 matches
5. **Set advancement** — how many teams advance to the next stage (for Elimination stages)
6. Repeat for additional stages

The platform automatically calculates how many groups you need based on total teams and group size.

## Advancement Rules

For Elimination stages, you set how many teams advance from each group. The platform handles the math:

- 16 groups × top 4 from each = 64 teams advance
- Those 64 feed into the next stage's groups automatically

> **Tip:** Make sure your advancement numbers add up cleanly. If the next stage has groups of 6, and you have 3 groups, you need exactly 18 teams advancing from the previous stage.

## Downloading Your Roadmap

Once your roadmap is built, you can download it as an image. Share this in your WhatsApp groups and Discord server so players can see the full tournament journey — from registration to finals.
