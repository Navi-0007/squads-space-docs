Every score update you make on SquadsSpace reflects across the platform in real-time. This powers the stream overlay and keeps your leaderboards always up-to-date.

## How It Works

SquadsSpace uses real-time data syncing. When you enter or update a score:
- The tournament leaderboard updates instantly
- The stream overlay (if connected) updates automatically
- Any player viewing the leaderboard page sees the change immediately

There's no "publish" or "refresh" step. Enter scores → everything updates.

## Entering Scores While Streaming

The most common workflow for streaming TOs:

1. **Laptop** — runs OBS with the stream overlay as a browser source
2. **Phone** — open SquadsSpace dashboard, enter scores after each match
3. As you type kills and placement on your phone, the overlay on your stream updates live

Your viewers see the leaderboard change in real-time without you ever touching your laptop.

## Use Cases

- **Live tournament streams** — viewers see standings update as matches finish
- **Between-round updates** — show accumulated points while the next match loads
- **Community engagement** — players watching the stream see their scores immediately
