When UID/IGN verification is enabled on a tournament, you can track individual kills per player — not just team totals.

## Prerequisites

- UID/IGN verification must be enabled on the tournament
- Players must have provided their Free Fire UID and IGN during registration

## How It Works

When entering match results for a team, instead of just entering the team's total kills, you expand the team card to see all registered players:

1. Open the match in your dashboard
2. Click on a team to expand their player list
3. Enter kills for each individual player
4. The platform calculates:
   - **Individual kill points** per player (kills × kill point value)
   - **Team total kills** (sum of all player kills)
   - **Team kill points** (team total × kill point value)
   - **Placement points** (based on team placement)
   - **Team total points** (kill points + placement points)

## Example

**Team: Phoenix Esports** — Placed 2nd

| Player | Kills | Kill Pts |
|--------|-------|----------|
| FF_Phoenix (Captain) | 6 | 6 |
| HeadHunter99 | 4 | 4 |
| SniperX | 3 | 3 |
| ClutchGod | 2 | 2 |
| **Team Total** | **15** | **15** |

Placement points (2nd place): 9
**Team Total Points: 15 + 9 = 24**

## Player Leaderboard

With per-player tracking enabled, SquadsSpace generates a player leaderboard showing individual performance across the tournament:

- Total kills per player
- Total kill points per player
- Matches played
- Average kills per match

This data is tied to verified UIDs, so there's no ambiguity about who performed.

## When to Use It

Per-player tracking adds a bit more work when entering scores (entering kills for each player instead of one team total), but it's worth it for:

- **Competitive tournaments** where individual performance matters
- **MVP awards** — easily identify the tournament's top fraggers
- **Dispute resolution** — verified kill counts tied to UIDs
- **Player scouting** — organizers and teams can spot talent

For casual scrims, team-level kill entry is usually sufficient.
