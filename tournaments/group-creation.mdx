SquadsSpace generates groups automatically based on your configuration. You set the rules — the platform builds the groups and assigns teams.

## How It Works

1. **Set group size** — how many teams per group (e.g., 12)
2. **Set group count** — the platform can calculate this from total teams ÷ group size, or you can set it manually
3. **Set assignment preferences** — how you want registrations distributed (e.g., balanced across groups)
4. **Choose invited slot handling** — spread across groups or dedicated group
5. Click **Generate** — the platform creates all groups and assigns teams instantly

## Assignment Preferences

When registrations are assigned to groups, you can set preferences:

- **Balanced** — teams are distributed as evenly as possible across all groups. If you have 192 teams and 16 groups, each group gets exactly 12 teams.

## Handling Invited Slots

If your stage has invited teams, you decide how they're placed:

### Spread Across Groups
Invited teams are distributed evenly across all groups. Each group gets roughly the same number of invited teams.

**Example:** 6 invited teams across 3 groups = 2 invited teams per group. The remaining slots in each group are filled by qualified teams.

### Dedicated Invited Group
All invited teams go into their own separate group(s). Qualified teams fill the other groups.

**Example:** 24 invited squads → the platform creates 2 dedicated "Invited" groups of 12. The remaining 168 qualified teams fill the other 14 groups.

> **Tip:** Use dedicated groups when you want invited teams to compete among themselves first before mixing with qualified teams in later stages.

## Scaling

The group creation system works the same whether you have 12 teams or 192:

- **12 teams, 1 group of 12** — simple scrim setup
- **48 teams, 4 groups of 12** — standard qualifier
- **192 teams, 16 groups of 12** — large-scale open tournament with 24 invited slots in 2 dedicated groups

You set the preferences once. The platform handles the rest.

## After Groups Are Created

Once groups are generated, you can:
- View all groups and their team assignments in your dashboard
- Start scheduling and running matches for each group
- Groups are independent — enter results for any group at any time
