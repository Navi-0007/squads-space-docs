SquadsSpace supports two event types: **Scrims** and **Tournaments**. Understanding the difference helps you pick the right one for your event.

## Scrims

A scrim is a single-group event with multiple matches. Think of it as a practice lobby or a weekly competitive session.

**Use scrims when:**
- You're running a daily or weekly practice lobby
- All teams play in one group
- You want cumulative points across multiple matches (e.g., 6 matches in one evening)
- No stages, no advancement — just play and see who's on top

**How it works:**
- One group of teams
- Multiple matches (up to 8)
- Points accumulate across all matches
- Final leaderboard shows combined standings

**Example:** 12 squads play 6 custom rooms on a Saturday evening. After all 6 matches, the leaderboard shows total points across all games. The top squad wins.

## Tournaments

A tournament is a multi-stage event with a roadmap. Teams progress through stages — qualifiers, semifinals, finals — with advancement rules at each stage.

**Use tournaments when:**
- You're running a competitive event with multiple rounds
- Teams need to qualify and advance through stages
- You want elimination, round robin, or a mix of both
- You need invited slots for pro teams

**How it works:**
- Multiple stages connected by a roadmap
- Each stage can be Elimination or Round Robin
- Set advancement rules (e.g., top 4 from each group advance)
- Results flow between stages automatically
- Supports invited slots at any stage

**Example:** 192 teams enter Open Qualifiers (16 groups of 12, Elimination format). Top 4 from each group advance to Semifinals (8 groups of 8). Top 3 from each advance to Grand Finals (4 groups of 6, Round Robin format). The combined Round Robin leaderboard determines the champion.

## Key Differences

| Feature | Scrim | Tournament |
|---------|-------|------------|
| Stages | One | Multiple |
| Roadmap | No | Yes |
| Advancement | No | Yes — auto or manual |
| Group count | One | As many as needed |
| Invited slots | No | Yes — any stage |
| Matches per group | Up to 8 | Up to 8 |
| Point calculation | Cumulative | Per stage + cumulative |
| Best for | Practice, weekly events | Competitive events, opens |

## Can I Convert Between Them?

Currently, you can't convert a scrim into a tournament or vice versa. Choose the right type when creating your event. If you're unsure, start with a scrim — it's simpler to set up and you can always create a tournament later.
