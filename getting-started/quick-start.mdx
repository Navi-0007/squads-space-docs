Get your first tournament running in under 5 minutes. This guide walks you through the basics — from creating a tournament to entering your first match scores.

## Step 1: Create Your Account

Sign up at [squadsspace.com](https://squadsspace.com) with your email. You'll be asked to create your club — this is your organizer profile that players will see.

> **Tip:** Use your actual club or community name. This is how players will find and recognize you.

## Step 2: Create a Tournament or Scrim

From your dashboard, click **Create New**.

You'll choose between two types:

- **Tournament** — Multi-stage event with a roadmap. Use this for qualifiers → semifinals → finals formats.
- **Scrim** — Single group, multiple matches. Use this for daily/weekly practice lobbies.

Not sure which to pick? See [Scrims vs Tournaments](/docs/getting-started/scrims-vs-tournaments).

## Step 3: Configure Your Settings

For either type, you'll set:

- **Game mode:** Solo, Duo, or Squad
- **Point table:** Set your custom kill points and placement points (e.g., 1 kill = 1 point, 1st place = 12 points)
- **Registration mode:** Open, Approval Required, Invite Only, or Invite with Approval
- **UID/IGN verification:** Toggle on if you want players to provide their Free Fire UID and In-Game Name

> **Tip:** For casual scrims, keep it simple — Open registration, no UID verification. For competitive tournaments, enable Approval Required + UID verification.

## Step 4: Share the Registration Link

Once your tournament is created, you get a registration link. Share it in your WhatsApp groups and Discord server. Players click the link, fill in their team details, and you see entries appear in your dashboard.

You can also add your WhatsApp group link and Discord server invite directly to the tournament page so players know where your community lives.

## Step 5: Enter Match Scores

After a match finishes:

1. Open the match in your dashboard
2. Enter each team's **kill count** and select their **placement** (1st through 12th)
3. The platform calculates total points instantly using your custom point table
4. Results feed into the tournament leaderboard automatically

That's it. No formulas. No calculator. No copy-pasting between sheets.

## Step 6: Share Results

Your leaderboard updates automatically. Players can check their standings on the platform. Share the link in your groups — done.

If you're streaming, grab your [Stream Overlay URL](/docs/live-streaming/stream-overlays) and add it to OBS for live-updating scoreboards.
