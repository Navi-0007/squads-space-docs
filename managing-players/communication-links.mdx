Add your WhatsApp group link and Discord server invite directly to your tournament page. Players know exactly where your community lives — SquadsSpace handles the tournament logistics.

## Adding Links

When creating or editing a tournament/scrim, you'll find fields for:

- **WhatsApp Group Link** — your community's WhatsApp group invite link
- **Discord Server Invite** — your Discord server's invite URL

These links appear on your tournament's public page. Players see them during and after registration.

## Why Add Links?

SquadsSpace is a tournament management tool, not a community platform. Your community stays on WhatsApp and Discord. Adding these links ensures:

- Players know where to find your community
- Match schedules and announcements reach players through your existing channels
- New registrants can join your groups immediately
- You don't lose community members to a separate platform

## Best Practices

- **Keep invite links active** — make sure your WhatsApp and Discord invites don't expire
- **Add both if you use both** — many Indian FF communities use WhatsApp for quick updates and Discord for detailed discussions
- **Update links if they change** — you can edit tournament settings anytime to update communication links
