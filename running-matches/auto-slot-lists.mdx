After a stage's matches are complete, SquadsSpace automatically knows which teams qualified. Generate the next round's slot list with one click — no more manual Excel work.

## How It Works

1. Finish entering all match results for a stage
2. The leaderboard shows final standings with qualified teams highlighted
3. Click **Generate Slot List** for the next stage
4. The platform creates the next round's groups with qualified teams already assigned
5. Share the slot list link in your WhatsApp and Discord groups

## What Gets Generated

The slot list shows:
- Which teams qualified from each group
- Their assigned group for the next stage
- Based on your group creation preferences (balanced distribution, invited slot handling, etc.)

## Sharing Slot Lists

Once generated, you can:
- Share the slot list link directly — players can check their assignment on the platform
- Drop the link in your Discord and WhatsApp groups
- Players see which group they're in and when their matches are scheduled

No more screenshotting Excel columns. No more tagging teams one by one in Discord.

## Manual Adjustments

Need to make changes after generating? You can adjust group assignments manually before the next stage begins. The platform won't lock you out of manual overrides.

## Example Flow

1. **Qualifiers complete** — 16 groups of 12 teams, top 4 from each advance
2. Click **Generate Slot List** for Semifinals
3. Platform creates Semifinal groups with the 64 qualified teams
4. Share the link: "Semifinal groups are up — check your slot"
5. Run Semifinals
6. Repeat for Finals
