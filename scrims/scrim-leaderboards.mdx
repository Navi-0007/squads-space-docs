Scrim leaderboards show cumulative standings across all matches in a scrim session.

## How It Works

After each match, the leaderboard updates with accumulated points:

- **Match 1:** Team A has 23 points, Team B has 17 points
- **Match 2:** Team A gets 15 more, Team B gets 22 more
- **Leaderboard:** Team A = 38, Team B = 39

The leaderboard always shows the running total. After the final match, it's the final standings.

## What the Leaderboard Shows

For each team:
- Total points across all matches
- Total kills across all matches
- Points per match breakdown
- Current ranking

If per-player kill tracking is enabled, you also get individual player stats across all matches.

## Sharing the Leaderboard

The leaderboard has a unique URL. Share it in your WhatsApp and Discord groups — players can check their standings anytime.

After the final match, the leaderboard becomes the final result. No additional step needed.
