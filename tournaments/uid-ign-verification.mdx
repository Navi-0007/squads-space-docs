UID/IGN verification is an optional setting that requires players to provide their Free Fire User ID and In-Game Name when registering. This enables per-player kill tracking and reduces disputes.

## Enabling Verification

When creating or editing a tournament, toggle on **UID/IGN Verification**. Once enabled:

- Players must enter their Free Fire UID (unique number) and IGN (display name) during registration
- Each player in a team must provide their own UID/IGN
- The platform stores this information and ties it to their tournament participation

## What Players See

When registering for a tournament with UID/IGN verification enabled, players fill in:

- Team name
- Each member's real name (or alias)
- Each member's Free Fire UID
- Each member's In-Game Name (IGN)

## Why Use It?

- **Per-player kill tracking** — with verified UIDs, you can track individual kills per player, not just team totals. See [Per-Player Kill Tracking](/docs/running-matches/per-player-kill-tracking).
- **Dispute prevention** — when someone claims "that wasn't my kill count," you have verified identities to reference
- **Anti-fraud** — prevents unauthorized substitutions (players swapping in without the TO knowing)
- **Player leaderboards** — individual performance stats tied to real identities

## When to Use It

| Scenario | UID/IGN Verification |
|----------|---------------------|
| Casual weekly scrim | Skip it — keep registration simple |
| Competitive tournament | Enable it — reduces disputes |
| Prize pool event | Definitely enable — you need accountability |
| Practice lobby with friends | Skip it — unnecessary friction |

## When to Skip It

For casual scrims or events where speed matters more than verification, skip UID/IGN collection. Registration will be faster and simpler. You can always enable it for your next event.

> **Tip:** If you're running a mix of scrims and tournaments, enable verification only on your competitive tournaments. Keep scrims frictionless.
