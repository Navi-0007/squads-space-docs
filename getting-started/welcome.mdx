SquadsSpace is a tournament management platform built specifically for Free Fire organizers in India. It handles everything you currently do in Excel, WhatsApp, and Discord — scores, registrations, group draws, leaderboards, and stream overlays — in one place.

## Who is SquadsSpace for?

- **Tournament Organizers (TOs)** who run Free Fire tournaments and scrims
- **Esports clubs and communities** managing regular competitive events
- **Content creators** who stream tournaments and need professional overlays

## What can you do with SquadsSpace?

- **Create tournaments and scrims** with custom formats, point tables, and registration settings
- **Enter match scores** and get instant point calculations — no more manual math
- **Generate leaderboards** that update automatically as you enter results
- **Stream with live overlays** — broadcast-ready scoreboards that update in real-time
- **Manage registrations** — 4 different modes from open to invite-only
- **Build tournament roadmaps** — multi-stage tournaments with elimination and round robin formats
- **Auto-generate slot lists** for the next round based on results
- **Track per-player kills** tied to verified Free Fire UIDs

## How is this different from what I'm doing now?

Right now, most Indian TOs run tournaments using a combination of WhatsApp groups, Discord servers, Google Sheets, and a calculator. SquadsSpace doesn't replace your WhatsApp or Discord — your community stays exactly where it is. SquadsSpace is the engine behind the scenes that eliminates the manual work: calculating scores, building slot lists, managing registrations, and creating overlays.
