Your point table defines how scores are calculated in your tournament. It has two components: kill points and placement points.

## Kill Points

A fixed value per kill. Common settings:

- **1 kill = 1 point** — standard across most Indian FF tournaments
- **1 kill = 2 points** — rewards aggressive gameplay
- **1 kill = 0.5 points** — reduces the impact of kills vs placement

## Placement Points

Points awarded based on a team's finishing position in a match. You define the value for each position (1st through 12th for a standard Free Fire lobby).

## Common Point Tables

### FFIC / Standard Format
The most commonly used format in Indian Free Fire esports:

| Placement | Points |
|-----------|--------|
| 1st (Booyah) | 12 |
| 2nd | 9 |
| 3rd | 8 |
| 4th | 7 |
| 5th | 6 |
| 6th | 5 |
| 7th | 4 |
| 8th | 3 |
| 9th | 2 |
| 10th | 1 |
| 11th | 0 |
| 12th | 0 |

Kill points: 1 per kill

### Kill-Heavy Format
For events that reward aggressive play:

| Placement | Points |
|-----------|--------|
| 1st (Booyah) | 15 |
| 2nd | 10 |
| 3rd | 8 |
| 4th-6th | 5 |
| 7th-9th | 3 |
| 10th-12th | 0 |

Kill points: 2 per kill

### Placement-Heavy Format
For events that reward survival:

| Placement | Points |
|-----------|--------|
| 1st (Booyah) | 20 |
| 2nd | 15 |
| 3rd | 12 |
| 4th | 10 |
| 5th | 8 |
| 6th | 6 |
| 7th-12th | 0 |

Kill points: 1 per kill

## Setting Your Point Table

When creating a tournament or scrim, you define your point table during setup. Enter the kill point value and the placement points for each position.

> **Tip:** If you're unsure, start with the FFIC standard format. It's what most Indian FF players are familiar with.

## How Points Are Calculated

For each match, each team's total points are:

**Total = (Kills × Kill Point Value) + Placement Points**

**Example:** A team gets 8 kills and places 2nd with FFIC format:
- Kill points: 8 × 1 = 8
- Placement points: 9 (for 2nd place)
- **Total: 17 points**

## Point Table Scope

Your point table currently applies across all stages of your tournament. All matches in all stages use the same kill and placement values.
