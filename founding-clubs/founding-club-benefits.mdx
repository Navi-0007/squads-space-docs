Founding Clubs are SquadsSpace's first 20 tournament organizers. If you've been accepted as a Founding Club, here's everything you get.

## Your Benefits

### 🚀 Early Access
You're the first to test every new feature before it goes public. Your feedback directly influences what we build next.

### ✅ Verified Founding Club Badge
A permanent badge on your club profile. Players see it and know you're one of the original 20. This badge can never be earned later — it's exclusive to Founding Clubs.

### 🤝 Priority Support
A dedicated setup manager helps you get started. Plus a direct line to the dev team — not a support ticket queue, real humans who built the platform.

### ⚡ Free Setup
We set up your first tournament with you. Roadmap, groups, point tables, registrations — we walk you through everything until you're comfortable running it solo.

### Additional Perks
- Direct input on new features — tell us what to build
- Priority listing when players search for tournaments
- Free access during the founding phase — no credit card required

## How Long Do Benefits Last?

- The **Verified Badge** is permanent and non-transferable
- **Priority Support** and **Free Setup** apply during onboarding
- **Early Access** is ongoing — you always get new features first
- **Free access** continues through the founding phase

As long as you're actively using the platform, your founding benefits stay.

## Can I Lose My Status?

The badge is permanent. We're looking for partners, not just users. As long as you're actively running events on SquadsSpace, your Founding Club status remains.
