This guide walks you through creating a multi-stage tournament from scratch.

## Step 1: Basic Info

From your dashboard, click **Create New** → **Tournament**.

Fill in:
- **Tournament name** — what players will see (e.g., "Phoenix Cup Season 3")
- **Game mode** — Solo, Duo, or Squad
- **Description** — rules, prizes, schedule (optional but recommended)

## Step 2: Set Your Point Table

Your point table defines how scores are calculated. You'll set:

- **Kill points** — how many points per kill (e.g., 1 kill = 1 point)
- **Placement points** — points based on finishing position

Common Free Fire point tables:

| Placement | FFIC Format | Custom Example |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| 1st | 12 | 15 |
| 2nd | 9 | 12 |
| 3rd | 8 | 10 |
| 4th | 7 | 8 |
| 5th | 6 | 6 |
| 6th | 5 | 5 |
| 7th | 4 | 4 |
| 8th | 3 | 3 |
| 9th | 2 | 2 |
| 10th | 1 | 1 |
| 11th | 0 | 0 |
| 12th | 0 | 0 |

> **Note:** Your point table currently applies across all stages of the tournament. Per-stage point tables are coming soon.

See [Point Tables](/docs/running-matches/point-tables) for more details.

## Step 3: Configure Registration

Choose one of four registration modes:

- **Open** — anyone with the link can register
- **Approval Required** — anyone can apply, you approve/reject each team
- **Invite Only** — only teams with an invite link can register
- **Invite with Approval** — invited teams still need your approval

You can also:
- Enable UID/IGN verification (players must provide their Free Fire UID)
- Add your WhatsApp group link and Discord server invite
- Set a registration deadline or auto-close when full

See [Registration Modes](/docs/tournaments/registration-modes) for details on each mode.

## Step 4: Build Your Roadmap

The roadmap defines your tournament stages. See [Roadmap Builder](/docs/tournaments/roadmap-builder) for the full guide, but here's the summary:

1. Add stages (e.g., Qualifiers → Semifinals → Finals)
2. For each stage, choose **Elimination** or **Round Robin**
3. Set group size and how many teams advance from each group
4. Set matches per group (up to 8)

## Step 5: Set Up Groups

For each stage, configure how groups are created:

- Set group size and count
- Set assignment preferences (e.g., balanced distribution)
- Choose how invited slots are handled (spread across groups or dedicated group)

The platform generates groups and assigns registrations automatically based on your preferences.

See [Group Creation](/docs/tournaments/group-creation) for details.

## Step 6: Go Live

Once everything is configured:
1. Publish your tournament
2. Share the registration link in your WhatsApp and Discord groups
3. Share the downloadable roadmap image so players can see the full journey

Your tournament is now live and accepting registrations.
