SquadsSpace gives you four registration modes. Choose the one that fits your event.

## Open Registration

Anyone with the registration link can sign up. No approval needed.

**Best for:** Large open tournaments, scrims, community events where you want maximum participation.

**How it works:**
1. Share the registration link
2. Teams fill in their details (team name, members, UIDs if required)
3. They're automatically registered — no approval step
4. Registration closes when slots are full or you close it manually

## Approval Required

Anyone can apply, but you review and approve each team before they're confirmed.

**Best for:** Competitive tournaments where you want to vet teams, or events with limited slots where you want control over who gets in.

**How it works:**
1. Share the registration link
2. Teams submit their application
3. You see each entry in your dashboard with status "Pending"
4. Review and click **Approve** or **Reject**
5. Approved teams are confirmed and counted toward your slot limit

> **Tip:** This is the most popular mode for serious tournaments. It lets you catch fake teams, duplicates, or teams that don't meet your requirements.

## Invite Only

Only teams who receive your private invite link can register. The tournament is not publicly listed.

**Best for:** Private scrims with your inner circle, invitational events, or closed practice sessions.

**How it works:**
1. Generate an invite link from your dashboard
2. Share it only with the teams you want to participate
3. Teams with the link can register directly
4. No one else can find or join the event

## Invite with Approval

The most restrictive mode. Teams need an invite link AND your approval to confirm their spot.

**Best for:** High-stakes invitationals where you want to verify every team even after inviting them.

**How it works:**
1. Generate and share invite links
2. Invited teams submit their registration
3. You review and approve each one
4. Only approved teams are confirmed

## Common Settings Across All Modes

Regardless of which mode you choose, you can also configure:

- **Auto-close** — registration automatically closes when all slots are filled
- **UID/IGN verification** — require players to provide their Free Fire UID and In-Game Name at registration. See [UID/IGN Verification](/docs/tournaments/uid-ign-verification)
- **Communication links** — add your WhatsApp group link and Discord server invite to the tournament page
- **Team size validation** — the platform checks that each team has the correct number of members for your game mode (1 for Solo, 2 for Duo, 4 for Squad)
- **Duplicate detection** — the platform flags duplicate entries automatically

## Which Mode Should I Use?

| Scenario | Recommended Mode |
|----------|-----------------|
| Weekly scrim with your community | Open |
| Competitive tournament, 100+ teams | Approval Required |
| Private practice with 12 specific teams | Invite Only |
