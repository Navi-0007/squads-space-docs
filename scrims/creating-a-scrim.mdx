Scrims are the quickest way to set up a competitive session. One group, multiple matches, cumulative leaderboard. Perfect for daily or weekly practice lobbies.

## Step by Step

1. From your dashboard, click **Create New** → **Scrim**
2. Fill in:
   - **Scrim name** (e.g., "Saturday Night Scrim" or "Phoenix Practice #47")
   - **Game mode** — Solo, Duo, or Squad
   - **Point table** — set your kill and placement values
   - **Number of matches** — how many games you plan to play (up to 8)
3. Configure registration (Open is most common for scrims)
4. Publish and share the registration link

## Running the Scrim

Once teams are registered and your lobby is ready:

1. Play Match 1
2. Enter results in your dashboard — kills and placement for each team
3. Platform calculates points instantly
4. Play Match 2, enter results
5. Repeat for all matches
6. The leaderboard accumulates points across all matches automatically

After the final match, the leaderboard shows total standings — the team with the most combined points wins.

## Tips

- **Keep registration Open** — scrims are casual, minimize friction
- **Skip UID verification** — save it for competitive tournaments
- **Use the stream overlay** — even for practice scrims, a live leaderboard makes it feel professional
- **8 matches max** — if you want more, create another scrim for the next session
