After a match finishes, enter the results in your dashboard. The platform calculates all points instantly using your custom point table.

## Step by Step

1. Open your tournament/scrim from the dashboard
2. Navigate to the match you want to score (e.g., "Group A — Match 1")
3. For each team, enter:
   - **Kill count** — total kills for the team in that match
   - **Placement** — their finishing position (1st through 12th)
4. Click **Calculate**

The platform instantly calculates:
- **Kill points** = kills × your kill point value
- **Placement points** = based on your placement point table
- **Total points** = kill points + placement points

All results feed into the group leaderboard and the overall tournament leaderboard automatically.

## Example

Your point table: 1 kill = 1 point, 1st place = 12 points, 2nd place = 9 points.

| Team | Placement | Kills | Kill Pts | Place Pts | Total |
|------|-----------|-------|----------|-----------|-------|
| Phoenix Esports | 1st | 11 | 11 | 12 | 23 |
| Clutch Kings | 2nd | 8 | 8 | 9 | 17 |
| Desi Dominators | 3rd | 14 | 14 | 8 | 22 |
| Team Starter | 4th | 5 | 5 | 7 | 12 |

Notice: Desi Dominators placed 3rd but almost beat the 1st place team on total points because of high kills. The point table handles this automatically.

## Editing Scores

Made a mistake? You can edit and recalculate results anytime before finalizing a stage. Just open the match, change the values, and click Calculate again. The leaderboard updates instantly.

## Multiple Matches

For events with multiple matches per group (scrims or multi-match stages), enter scores for each match separately. The leaderboard accumulates points across all matches automatically.

**Example:** A scrim with 6 matches. After entering all 6 match results, the leaderboard shows each team's total points across all 6 games.

## Per-Player Kill Entry

If you have UID/IGN verification enabled, you can enter kills per player instead of just team totals. See [Per-Player Kill Tracking](/docs/running-matches/per-player-kill-tracking) for details.

## Tips

- Enter scores right after each match while they're fresh — less chance of errors
- If you're streaming, scores entered on your phone update the [Stream Overlay](/docs/live-streaming/stream-overlays) in real-time
- You can enter scores for different groups independently — no need to wait for all groups to finish
