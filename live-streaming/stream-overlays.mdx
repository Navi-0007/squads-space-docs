SquadsSpace provides browser-based overlays you can add to OBS, Streamlabs, or any streaming software. Your stream gets a broadcast-ready scoreboard that updates in real-time as you enter scores.

## Getting Your Overlay URL

1. Open your tournament or scrim
2. Go to **Overlay Settings**
3. Copy the overlay URL

This URL is a browser page that displays your live standings, kill counts, and match results. It's designed to be used as a browser source in streaming software.

## Adding to OBS

1. In OBS, click **+** under Sources
2. Select **Browser**
3. Paste your overlay URL
4. Set the width and height to match your stream layout (recommended: 1920×1080 for full-screen, or smaller for a sidebar overlay)
5. Click **OK**

The overlay is now part of your stream. It will update automatically whenever you enter or update scores on SquadsSpace.

## Adding to Streamlabs

1. In Streamlabs, add a new **Browser Source**
2. Paste the overlay URL
3. Adjust size and position
4. Done — same live-updating behavior

## How Real-Time Updates Work

When you enter scores on SquadsSpace — from your phone, laptop, or any device — the overlay detects the change and updates automatically. There's no refresh needed.

**Workflow:**
1. Match ends
2. You open SquadsSpace on your phone
3. Enter kills and placement for each team
4. Your stream's overlay updates live — viewers see the leaderboard change in real-time

This means you can enter scores on your phone while the stream runs on your laptop. No alt-tabbing. No manual graphic editing.

## Overlay Design

The overlay is designed to match professional esports broadcast aesthetics. It shows:
- Team standings with points
- Kill counts
- Match-by-match results
- Clean typography and colors optimized for stream readability

## Tips

- **Test before going live** — add the overlay to OBS and enter a few test scores to see how it looks on your stream
- **Position wisely** — place the overlay where it won't cover important gameplay. A sidebar or bottom bar works well
- **Use your phone** — enter scores from your phone while the stream runs on your laptop. The overlay updates automatically
- **Multiple monitors help** — if you have two screens, keep SquadsSpace open on one and your stream on the other
