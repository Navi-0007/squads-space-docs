You've been accepted — welcome. Here's what happens next.

## Step 1: Your Setup Manager Reaches Out

Within 24 hours of acceptance, your dedicated setup manager will contact you on Discord. They'll schedule a walkthrough at a time that works for you.

## Step 2: Guided Walkthrough

In a 30-60 minute session, your setup manager will:

1. Help you create your club profile
2. Set up your first tournament or scrim together
3. Walk you through the Roadmap Builder (if you're creating a tournament)
4. Configure your point table based on how you currently run events
5. Set up registration with your preferred mode
6. Show you how to enter scores and generate leaderboards
7. Set up your stream overlay (if you stream)

By the end of this session, you'll have a fully configured event ready to go.

## Step 3: Run Your First Event

Take what you set up and run it live. Your setup manager is available on Discord if you hit any issues during your first event.

## Step 4: Give Feedback

As a Founding Club, your feedback shapes the platform. After your first event, let us know:

- What worked well?
- What was confusing?
- What feature do you wish existed?
- What would you change?

We take this seriously — Founding Club feedback goes directly to the development roadmap.

## Getting Help After Setup

After your initial walkthrough, you can always reach us on Discord for:
- Technical issues
- Feature requests
- Questions about platform capabilities
- Help setting up complex tournament formats

You have a direct line to the team. Use it.
