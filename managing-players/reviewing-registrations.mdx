When you use Approval Required or Invite with Approval registration modes, you'll need to review incoming team applications.

## The Registration Dashboard

Your registration dashboard shows all entries with their current status:

- **✅ Approved** — confirmed and counted toward your slot limit
- **⏳ Pending** — waiting for your review
- **❌ Rejected** — declined (the team is notified)
- **⚠️ Flagged** — duplicate detected or validation issue

## Reviewing an Entry

Click on any pending entry to see:
- Team name
- Member names
- Free Fire UIDs and IGNs (if verification is enabled)
- Registration timestamp
- Any flags (duplicates, incomplete info)

From there, click **Approve** or **Reject**.

## Duplicate Detection

The platform automatically flags potential duplicates:
- Same team name registered twice
- Same UID appearing in multiple team entries
- Same player name across different teams

Flagged entries show a **⚠️** icon. Review them carefully — sometimes players genuinely switch teams between registrations.

## Bulk Actions

For large tournaments with many registrations:
- Review entries in order (newest first or oldest first)
- Approve or reject directly from the list view without opening each entry

## Auto-Close

When all available slots are filled (counting only approved teams), registration automatically closes. Late entries see a "Registration Closed" message.

You can also manually close registration at any time, regardless of how many slots are filled.

## Tips

- **Review regularly** — don't let pending entries pile up. Players get anxious waiting for confirmation
- **Check UIDs** — if verification is on, make sure UIDs look valid (they're numeric and the right length)
- **Communicate rejections** — if you reject a team, they'll know. Be prepared for follow-up questions in your Discord
